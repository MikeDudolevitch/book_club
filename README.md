Thank you for using the Book Club web application! This application uses a Ruby on Rails framework to run from front- to back-end. As a user, you can sign in by creating submitting your email, a password, and creating a username, or by signing in using your Google account. Once successfully signed into the app, you have the option to view all existing book clubs that users have created, and once you have selected one, you have the option to join it which will show the virtual meeting link. From the same dropdown bar, you can select a page that shows you all the clubs in which you are a member.
Additionally, you are able to use the 'create club' function create your own club! You can set the club's name, the days for each meetup, and supply a link for virtual meetups. This will also set you as the admin of that club. As admin, you have the ability to set the book the members are going to reading through the 'create book' link. Admins can also update the group's info, or delete it altogether. 
From the dashboard page, you are able to check out what books are being read, and the top 5 most recent book additions in various clubs. 
When finished, simply click the 'logout' button on the top nav-bar.
Thanks for using the Book Club app!
